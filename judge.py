    This class exists to help create an evaluation function for
    the decision tree. It measures how much deviation from ideal
    behavior exists in a set of days. It is used to determine which
    leaves of the decision tree are most ripe for splitting and
    how that split should occur.

    Because it is a somewhat
    messy calculation and depends on the data history, it needs to
    be initialized with and remember the data set that it is associated
    with. Putting the evaluate() function in its own class is the
    cleanest way to do this.
